# Connect 4
Connect Four is a popular connection board game that has become a family favorite over the years! 

In Connect 4, each player has their own unique set of colored discs, and the objective of the game is to get 4 of your discs in a row. The board is made up of 7 columns and 6 six rows, and players alternate turns after they drop their disc into any open slot they'd like. Don't forget, you can get 4 in row from any direction, as long they're all in one line. If the board fills up and no one reached their goal, then that game ends in a tie. Enjoy the game everyone!

## Next Steps
1. I'd like to make the play again / reset button look more accessible by adding color or an animation around it.

2. I want to incoroporate an audio sound for anytime someone wins the game.

3. I'd like to animate the game pieces by having them drop into the game board, like how it looks with a physical board.

4. I'd like to incorporate AI levels with different options of difficulty.
